题目：[1781750] 英语写作练习,"Title: The Beauty of My Hometown
Hometown is the place where we grew up and also the one that filled our childhood with laughters and expectations. However, many students have to go to college in faraway places, which makes them feel more attached to their hometown. Now that most universities have postponed the return date of their students for the new semester  because of the Novel Coronavirus epidemic, we are inviting you to write an essay of about 200 words to introduce your hometown, describing the  beauty of its landscape, or the anecdotes and enlightening experiences associated with it which impressed you most.

题目：我美丽的故乡
家乡是我们生长的地方，是家乡让我们的童年充满欢笑和希望。因为上大学的原因，很多学生远离家乡到外地求学，这让莘莘学子对家乡又多了一份情感与依恋。今年春节因为疫情的关系，大部分学校延后了新学期返校时间，那就让我们利用这个机会写一篇200个单词左右的英文短文来好好夸一夸自己的家乡，看看她到底美在什么地方，还有哪些让你印象深刻的美景、趣事、感悟、新知……
