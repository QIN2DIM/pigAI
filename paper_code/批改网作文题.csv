"题目：[330773] chapter 4, 79 Task A: precis writing","79In the twentieth century numerous new nations have been formed. Though their people often enjoy full political liberty, there exist at the same time a great many strange practices. Native populations may be free to vote and to elect whom they please to govern them, but popular prejudices, unusual and harmful custom take a long time to die out. However, now that people are better educated, they need not suffer in silence, for they are able to express their views. With the spread of civilization, improved living conditions, the cheapness of radio sets, books and newspapers, most people are fairly well-informed. In this way many unpleasant customs disappear rapidly. There was a good example of this recently in a newly formed republic when a girl of fourteen refused to marry a sixty year old man who had bought her for 40. Her father had agreed to the marriage when the girl was only four years old and had ‘sold’ her to a man who already had at least six wives. Just before the marriage ceremony, the girl ran away and wrote to the president of the republic. In her letter she pointed out that although her country was independent its people were still not truly free. Some human beings were like slaves, she said, and women could be bought and sold like cattle. She asked the president if he felt that this was right. This letter caused the president a great deal of concern and he immediately changed the cruel law which permitted women to be bought and sold. The girl had won a considerable victory but she still had big problem. She had to find 40 to repay the man who might have become her husband. There seemed to be no way of raising so much money. Fortunately, however, the girl’s story was broadcast on a radio program in Europe and nearly 2000 poured in from listeners. The buyer got his money back and the girl was free to marry anyone she chose. She had won true freedom for herself and for others like her.1   COMPREHENSIONGive short answers to these questions in your own words as far as possible. Use one complete sentence for each answer.(a) What sometimes prevents people in newly formed nations from enjoying true freedom?(b) What has been the effect of the spread of education and improved living conditions?(c) To whom was the girl ‘sold’? 2      PRECISIn not more than 80 words describe what the girl did to win her freedom and explain how money was collected to pay back the man who had bought her. Use your own words as far as possible. Do not include anything that is not in the last paragraph."

题目：[497661] 高中学生读写大赛  Reading to writing,"After a great victory over Kalinga, King Ashoka was quite pleased
and promised that whoever wishes anything would be given to him or her. He made
the promise, but he never thought what would happen! People of Kalinga marched
towards the ground, where the King himself was offering the offers. It was a
long queue. The proud King stood there, like a lion! One after another came and
took the offer as they wished. After sometime, it was the turn of an old lady.
The King was extremely surprised at her appearance! Perhaps, she was on her
late eighty and she was lean and thin. Every part of her body was wrinkled. Her
eyes were pushed inside, making her cheek bones prominent(凸出的). Her most shocking feature was
her sharp grey eyes. Even, she was unable to walk properly. She took her
support with an uneven stick. Looking at her poor condition, the King felt pity
for her and very politely asked, ‘Oh, mother! Why didn’t you ask someone of
your family, to come and collect the thing you want? What do you want?’The old lady raised her head slightly. She glared at the King, her
eyes sparkled, then said, ‘First you promise me that you will fulfill my wish
then I shall express it!’The King was rather surprised with her expression, and said in a
firm voice, ‘Well then, I do promise that whatever in this earth you want, I am
ready to pay you! This is the ‘word’ of a King! Trust me. Express your wish!’The old lady looked at his face sternly, then said, ‘Oh, noble,
mighty King! I had three sons and all my three sons died in this battle. If you
can, please return my three sons! I don’t want anything, anything except my
sons!’The King was taken aback! He became speechless for a moment. He then
tried to pacify the lady with other most valuable offerings. But the old lady
was too stubborn to be pacified. When the King Ashoka, failed to fulfill her
desire, she said angrily, ‘Oh, King! Why did you make a promise to me, the
thing which you can not give? You have no right to snatch the things from
others, which is beyond your capacity to return! And remember, if you fail to
keep your promise, better not to make any promise at all!’ The old lady turned
her anguished face and slowly walked away.The lady went away, but the words she uttered, drew a deep impact in
his mind. Her voice echoed in his ears in every second. King Ashoka stood like
a statue for few moments! He felt, as if his blood was drained out. He became
helpless and powerless! All his bravery, reputation smashed out within a
second. Slowly, the day was followed by the night and he left the place, with a
heavy heart.

题目：[227750] Learning Chinese Fever in the World,"Do you feel learning English is a headache? Here is good news for you: today, about 30 million people around the world are learning Chinese, and various educational institutions in over 100 countries have offered Chinese courses. More than 540,000 people from 120 countries have participated in the HSK examination (Han Yu Shui 
Ping Kao Shi) to date. These figures are encouraging, and it seems that Chinese may well become the second most popular international language, just behind English. 
    
Through this phenomenon, we can see clearly that the pace of China’s advance in the world arena is rapid. China’s international status has also been rising rapidly. Besides, the 5000-year-old splendid history of Chinese civilization is another aspect counting for the highly increasing number of students studying Chinese. Numerous foreigners have stepped into this ancient land, appreciating Chinese culture. Additionally, China’s rapid economic growth and especially its entry to the WTO attribute greatly to the  

fever. More and more business people cast their eyes on the Chinese market, and want to get more profit from it, which largely inspires the enthusiasm for learning the Chinese language. 
     
The rising Chinese language fever has spawned (大量产生) a great number of “Chinese 
courses” all across the world. In the coming years, as our country’s economic and cultural links expand, the number of foreigners learning Chinese is expected to multiply (增多), and there 

will be a great demand for Chinese teachers. Maybe someday, we will be able to go abroad to teach foreigners Chinese! But, remember, we need to sharpen our English first in order to teach them in a more effective and efficient way."
